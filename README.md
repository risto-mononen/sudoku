sudoku
======
sudoku solver and maybe a generator some day in the future.

# TODO:
1. Update unit tests. **DONE**.
1. Refactor to follow the [common terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Sudoku): cell, row, col, box, candidates, value.
1. Read and write sudokus, ASCII stdin & stdout would be nice.
1. Specify and enforce invariants. They will be useful for both generating and solving the sudokus.
1. Generate sudokus.
1. Solve sudokus. Algorithms: backtracing / trial and error, or clever logic.
